# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

There are 3 components :
App - Main component
RollDice - Action for roll dice with a button that generate the random number from 1 - 6

Simply fun small project using class component. Take a way from here is reviewing how we use components and props. Nothing special but simply a fun little thing
